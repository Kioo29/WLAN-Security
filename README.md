# WLAN-Security
This project was completed as part of the INSE 6190 course at my University and demonstrates various WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) security vulnerabilities and corresponding attack techniques.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to simulate and demonstrate common WLAN attacks in a controlled lab environment. Each module includes a video demonstration and visual documentation of the attack process.

Key Attacks Demonstrated
Deauthentication Attack

Demonstrates disconnecting users from a Wi-Fi network via spoofed deauth packets.
Password Recovery

Showcases techniques to recover wireless passwords from compromised devices or captured traffic.
DNS Spoofing & MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)

Redirects traffic to malicious sites by poisoning DNS responses, combined with interception.
Fake Access Point (Evil Twin)

Simulates a rogue access point to capture user credentials and traffic.
Tools Used
Wireshark for packet analysis
Aircrack-ng and related tools for wireless penetration testing
Kali Linux as the primary testing environment
Author & Credit
This project was developed by me and my teammates as part of the curriculum for the INSE 6190 course on wireless security.
